# TQT bot

Bot to access [tqt](https://github.com/indigotech/tqt) remotely on users behalf.

(Based on [slack's example](https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-client/blob/master/examples/simple_reverse.coffee) code)

## Usage example

## Pending

- [ ] Decide how/where to host it (machine needs to have TQT CLI installed and properly configured)
- [ ] Create github user to exec all github related commands
- [ ] Review commands that are allowed and make sense for the bot
- [ ] local tests showed `exec` to be really slow to respond, needs improvement
